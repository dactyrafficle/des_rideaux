X^2 should be treated as endogenous

from the conditioning theorem
E[g(X)e] = E[ E[g(X)e|X] ] = E[ g(X) E[e|X] ]

therefore 
E[X^2e] = E[ E[ X^2 e|X] ] = E[ X^2 E[e|X] ]

and noting that E[e|X] \ne 0 because
E[Xe] \ne 0
E[Xe] = E [ E[Xe|X] ] = E [ X E[e|X] ] \ne 0
which only works if E[e|X] \ne 0

so, therefore, since E[e|X] \ne 0, E[X^2e] \ne 0, so X^2 is endogenous </pre>

<p> we should look at <span class='math'>X</span> and <span class='math'>X^2</span> as 2 separate regressors. so we have 2 endogenous regressors, and thus we need at least 2 valid instruments </p>
<p> i think that by suggesting the use of <span class='math'>(1, Z, Z^2)</span> as instruments, what is being asked is that we use <span class='math'>Z</span> and <span class='math'>Z^2</span> as instruments for <span class='math'>X</span> and <span class='math'>X^2</span> </p>

<p> the first-stage equations become </p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class='math'> X = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 Z + \gamma_2 Z^2 + u </span></p>
<li><p><span class='math'> X^2 = \delta_0 + \delta_1 Z + \delta_2 Z^2 + v </span></p>
</ul>

<p> the result of the first-stage is : </p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class='math'> \hat{X} = \hat{\gamma}_0 + \hat{\gamma}_1 Z + \hat{\gamma}_2 Z^2 </span></p>
<li><p><span class='math'> \hat{X}^2 = \hat{\delta}_0 + \hat{\delta}_1 Z + \hat{\delta}_2 Z^2 </span></p>
</ul>

<p> the model is <span class='inline-code'>just-identified</span>, since we have m=2 endogenous regressors, and k=2 valid instruments </p>

<p> On page 342 of Hansen, Hansen discusses Card (1995), where age and age^2 are used as instruments for experience and experience^2 </p>
<p> Hansen notes that Card used experience and experience^2 as distinct regressors, and makes a value judgement affirming the decision </p>
