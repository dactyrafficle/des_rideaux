consider a study to evaluate the effect on college student grades of dorm room Internet connections.

regress grades ~ dorm_room_internet_connections

in a large dorm, half the rooms are randomly wired for high speed Internet connections (the treatment
group), and final course grades are collected for all residents. 

which of the following pose a threat to internal validity, and why?


first, before i answer anything, this is a hard question, because there's no formal definition for causality. not really. not without getting weird.

say im a wealthy former student, and want to donate money, and i am considering paying for widespread internet access, and i wanna know if it actually helps the students academic outcomes

so when we look for beta of grades ~ x, what are we looking for ? because there is no logical link between the y and x, so it might be that were looking to see that, if x=1, it might improve efficiency, change behaviors, etc


a) Midway through the year, all the male athletes move into a fraternity and drop out of the study
(their final grades are not observed).


b) Engineering students assigned to the control group put together a local area network so that they
can share a private wireless Internet connection that they pay for jointly.

c) The political studies majors in the treatment group never learn how to access their Internet
accounts.

d) The economics majors in the treatment group provide access to their Internet connection to
those in the control group, for a fee. 

this would be a problem.
